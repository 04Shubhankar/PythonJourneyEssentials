"""
This Python code snippet does the following:

open("myfile.txt", "r"): Opens the file named "myfile.txt" in read mode ('r'). This returns a file object.
list(): Converts the file object into a list. This reads the entire contents of the file and splits it into lines, creating a list of strings where each element represents a line from the file.
